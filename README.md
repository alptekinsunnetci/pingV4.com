# pingV4.com
PingV4.com is a PHP and javascript-based online and open-source web site that helps you track access to your servers and the routes associated with those accesses.


There are two different probe files. The file named pingV4.Probe.php has advanced features. The file named pingV4.ping.php has a simplified structure. We want you to host both probe files. 


The two files hosted by you require a minimum of PHP version 5.4. The exec, proc_get_status and proc_open functions should be enabled in PHP.


Thank you for supporting this project.
