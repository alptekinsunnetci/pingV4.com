# pingV4.com

PingV4.com is an open-source web application, built with PHP, HTML, and JavaScript, designed to help you monitor access to your servers and analyze the associated routes.

We offer two distinct probe files: pingV4.Probe.php, which boasts advanced features, and pingV4.ping.php, featuring a more straightforward structure. We kindly request that you host both of these probe files.

Please note that the hosting environment for these files should meet specific requirements, including a minimum PHP version of 5.4, and the PHP functions exec, proc_get_status, and proc_open should be enabled.

We genuinely appreciate your support for this project and the valuable role you play in making it a success.
